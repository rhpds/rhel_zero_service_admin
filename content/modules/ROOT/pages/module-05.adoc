=== Restarting a Service to Apply Configuration Changes

To demonstrate how configuration changes behave when a service is
already running, add an export directory to the NFS service on this
system:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
echo "/home" >> /etc/exports
----

This command adds the home directory to the export list configuration
file for NFS. Changing this config file does not lead to any immediate
changes in the NFS service, though. Print the export list again to
confirm this:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
showmount -e
----

[source,text]
----
Export list for rhel:
----

To bring configuration changes into the service, you must first use
`+systemctl+` to restart it:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
systemctl restart nfs-server
----

Now the configuration files have been re-read and NFS reflects the
configuration change.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
showmount -e
----

[source,text]
----
Export list for rhel:
/home *
----

The home directory is now listed as an exported drive that is available
to all NFS clients. If you ever run into a scenario where you are unable
to see configuration changes, make sure you check whether or not you
have restarted the service and reloaded the config files.
